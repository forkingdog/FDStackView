# FDStackView

Use UIStackView as if it supports iOS6.

# Problem

UIStackView is a very handy tool to build flow layout, but it's available only when iOS9+, we've found some great compatible replacements like OAStackView, but we want more:  

- **Perfect downward compatible**, no infectivity, use UIStackView **directly** as if it's shipped from iOS6.
- **Interface builder support**, live preview.
- Keep layout constraints as closely as UIStackView constructs.

# Usage

#### Podfile
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "FDStackView", "1.0-alpha"
```

**Import nothing, learn nothing, it just works.**

- It will automatically replace the symbol for UIStackView into FDStackView at runtime before iOS9. 

``` objc
// Works in iOS6+, use it directly.
UIStackView *stackView = [[UIStackView alloc] init];
stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal;
stackView.distribution = UIStackViewDistributionFill;
stackView.alignment = UIStackViewAlignmentTop;
[stackView addArrangedSubview:[[UILabel alloc] init]];
[self.view addSubview:stackView];
```

- Interface Builder Support

Set `Builds for` option to `iOS 9.0 and later` to eliminate the version error in Xcode:

Now, use UIStackView as you like and its reactive options and live preview:

# Requirements

- Xcode 7+ (For interface builder supports and the latest Objective-C Syntax)
- Base SDK iOS 9.0+ (To link UIStackView symbol in UIKit)
